Required homework

First, do the required readings.

Please work on and submit these exercises before you arrive (submission details are below). These are required; we want you to be ready for class when it starts.

Test-First Ruby (Alex Chaffee)

Test-First Ruby is a great way to test your Ruby knowledge. It gives you interactive feedback, so you can find and correct mistakes. It will also give you practice running RSpec tests (complete level 1 of CodeSchool’s RSpec course if you need a refresher on RSpec).

The required exercises are 0-12 and 14. To begin work, go to the github page and click to download the ZIP file. Extract the ZIP and open the contained README.md. This will contain further instructions as to how to proceed.

When you’re finished with Test First Ruby, send it to us (instructions below).

Errata

NB: the rake task will not work if you save it to a directory path that includes a space. For instance, /Users/FNAME LNAME/learn_ruby contains a space. If necessary, move the learn_ruby to a directory path that doesn’t contain a space.

Submitting Your Work

When done, please zip your Test First Ruby folder (complete with instructions, specs, and your solutions) and mail it to us at admissions@appacademy.io.
